# Watch Mouse Controller

The application allows the user to control the cursor with an Android device. It is a crossplatform application (untested on Mac OSX).
External contributions as pull requests are welcome!

## Description

The program is in three parts :

- Watch application (Android SDK 20+)
- Mobile application (Android SDK 19+)
- Computer application (Java 8)

Mobile application is a bridge between watch and computer. In a near future, when the watch will can open directly sockets with the computer, the mobile will not be necessary anymore.

In addition to the move and click events, the program offers new and orginal way to reach a distant target. In fact, due to the size of a watch screen, users have to make a lot of movements. This application propose to solve this issue with a new mode when you reach the edge of the watch.

## Installation

Mobile and watch parts are build as Android Studio Project. You can download Android Studio [here] (https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html).
Import the projects and install them on the desired device.

To install the computer application you need :

- Visual Studio (on Windows) [Download](https://www.visualstudio.com/)
- qMake or make (on OSX and Linux)
- Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 8 or more and Java JDK 8 or more (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)

First of all, you need to compile the libpointing application:
  
  If you want the lastest version of libpointing : With a terminal go in the libpointing directory and "git pull"
  
### On Windows 

- Open the "pointing" project with Visual Studio in 'libpointing' directory
- Choose "Release x86" and Generate->"Generate pointing"
- Choose "Release x64" (if your system runs on a 64 bits architecture) and Generate->"Generate pointing"
- You can close the project
- Go to the directory : "libpointing\bindings\Java\Jar"
- Launch "compile.bat" On some Windows system, 'javac' application is not in the Path. To add it, find your JDK installation directory (C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_92\bin for example) and follow these [instructions](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/path.xml)
- Go to 'msvc' directory
- Edit the 'libpointingJavaBindingDll.vcxproj' file (with [NotePad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) for example) : Search "jdk1.8.0_91" (for example) and replace with your own version of JDK (jdk1.8.0_92 for example). If your JDK is for 32 bits Architecture and you are on a 64 bits architecture search "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_91" and replace with "C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jdk1.8.0_92"
- Save the modifications and open the libpointingJavaBindingDll project with Visual Studio
- Choose "Release x86" and Generate->"Generate libpointingJavaBindingDll"
- Choose "Release x64" (if your system runs on a 64 bits architecture) and Generate->"Generate libpointingJavaBindingDll"
- If everything is fine you have just generated the dll libraries in libpointing\bindings\Java\Jar\build\x86 and/or x64\Release
- You can now generate the jar file with the script "makejar.bat" (Necessary only if you want to edit the code)
- Open a terminal and test your java version with "java -version"
- If your runtime environment is in 64 bits you can now launch the computer application with the scripts in 'MouseMotionServer' directory : "run_server_without_test_interface" or "run_server_with_test_interface" 
- Else edit the previous scripts and change 'x64' by 'x86'

### On Linux/OSX : 

- See the installation guide of libpointing [here](https://github.com/INRIA/libpointing/wiki/Installation)

## How to use?

- Be sure that the ip address of computer is accessible
- Be sure that the bluetooth is activated on mobile and it is connected on the same network as the computer
- Launch "run_server_without_test_interface" or "run_server_with_test_interface"
- With test interface go to Tools->Settings and get ip address
- Launch application on mobile
- Put the previously getting ip adress and a port (by default between 4444 and 4453)
- Click to connect, a message tells you if you are connected to the server. Moreover the server print a message to indicate that the connexion is accepted
- You can put your phone in your pocket
- Launch watch application
- Choose your position around the computer
- You can now control the cursor with your watch !

## Description of features

The following describes the different way to control the cursor when you reach the edge of the watch. It could be change dynamically with the option interface
 
 - "Accroissement Quadratique" : The distance is calculated with the difference between the origin angle (angle when the system enter in "Border mode") and the current angle. More you open the angle, more the next movement will be big
 - "Vitesse  = f(angle)" : An angle increase is reflected by an increase of the speed. If the speed is not equal to 0, the cursor moves alone, without any user interactions on the watch
 - "Blocage avant" : More you stay in border mode, more the cursor moves fast. ( The function is actually ln(delta_t + 1) ). 'delta_t' is the difference between the current time and the time when system enters in "Border Mode"
 - "Mapping direct angle -> d√©placement" : The distance is calculated with the difference between the current angle and the previous one. 
 - A drag and drop application can be launched. Allow the user to take pictures from an explorer and drop them into the application in order to test the different features.
 - Adjusts the area to enter in "Border Mode"(in % of watch screen)
 - Adjusts the time to wait to enter in "Border Mode"
 - Adjusts the speed with the time between two moves calculation in "Vitesse  = f(angle)" and "Blocage avant" features
 - To controle speed and sensibility in "Border Mode" you can adjust a coefficient that divide the calculated angle
 - Allows a preview mode (enable by default) with different informations to draw. This mode draws informations about the next position of cursor in "Border Mode" instead of moving it. Drag outside the edge area valids the movement. Double click to remove it
 - Allows to change the default port where the server will listen connections. In the launcher script just add an integer as argument for the program. The listened ports will be [integer, integer+10[ (4444-4453)
 
## Edit the application

The server application is build as [Eclipse](https://eclipse.org/downloads/) project. You need the jdk if you want to modify the code or launch the application with Eclipse.

You have to add VM arguments as in the following example [here] (https://github.com/INRIA/libpointing/wiki/Java) (same argument that in scripts) and add to the classpath the previous compiled jar of libpointing (libpointing.jar that you can find in "MouseMotionServer\libpointing\bindings\Java\Jar")

Please consider to NOT commit your own modified classpath and/or your own modified launcher scripts in your fork for a potential merge: 

- git update-index --assume-unchanged MouseMotionServer\\.classpath
- git update-index --assume-unchanged MouseMotionServer\run_server_without_test_interface.bat
- git update-index --assume-unchanged MouseMotionServer\run_server_with_test_interface.bat

You can create your own listener by inheriting the abstract class [IMouseListener](https://github.com/Rylith/TouchpadTestV2/blob/master/MouseMotionServer/src/mouse/control/IMouseListener.java). It implements a lot of features as the way to enter and exit of "border mode" or the click and release action, the calcul of sign etc... You just have to implements your own onScroll method to describe the behaviour of your listener when a move action occured on the watch. You can take inspiration on the existing listeners. 

However every listnener is adapted to Round watch. In case of Square watch may be it will be usefull to reconsider the way to detect the edges.

To use your own listener don't forget to add a title and the class name of your listener in "mouseChoice" map in [OptionsInterface](https://github.com/Rylith/TouchpadTestV2/blob/master/MouseMotionServer/src/gui/OptionsInterface.java) class or change the default listener in [DeliverCallBackTest](https://github.com/Rylith/TouchpadTestV2/blob/master/MouseMotionServer/src/network/Impl/DeliverCallbackTest.java) class.

If you create new parameters and you want change them dynamically, you can add them in [OptionsInterface](https://github.com/Rylith/TouchpadTestV2/blob/master/MouseMotionServer/src/gui/OptionsInterface.java) class.

A branch of the application exists in order to implement a "cursor per user" program. You can contribute on it as well.
