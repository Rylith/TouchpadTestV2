Canvas Pong
===========

This example is used to demonstrate the libpointing API.

The original game was taken from [here](http://codeincomplete.com/posts/2011/5/14/javascript_pong/demo.html)

It was a bit modified to make use of pointing devices.

Prerequisites
=============

* Libpointing (`brew install libpointing-binary` for now, later on, we will put it in npm).
* Node bindings (enter `make -C ..`)

Execution
=========

* npm install
* node index
* open your browser and go to localhost:3000
